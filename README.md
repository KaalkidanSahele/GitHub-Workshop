# GitHub-Workshop

This is the read me I use alongside the workshop tutorials!

Visit the "Getting Started with GitHub + IDEs" PDF file to see the tutorial in full! Let's aim to work together in pairs so we can simulate a development team together :)

Don't hesistate to ask for helps/ tip and tricks/ anything!
